    title: IntelliMan (AI-Powered Manipulation System for Advanced Robotic Service, Manufacturing and Prosthetics)
    excerpt: >-
      This project is focusing on the question of “How a robot can efficiently learn to manipulate in a purposeful and highly performant way”. IntelliMan will range from learning individual manipulation skills from human demonstration, to learning abstract descriptions of a manipulation task suitable for high-level planning, to discovering an object’s functionality by interacting with it, to guarantee performance and safety. IntelliMan aims at developing a novel AI-Powered Manipulation System with persistent learning capabilities, able to perceive the main characteristics and features of its surrounding by means of a heterogeneous set of sensors, able to decide how to execute a task in an autonomous way and able to detect failures in the task execution in order to request new knowledge through the interaction with humans and the environment. IntelliMan further investigates how such AI-powered manipulation systems are perceived by the users and what factors enhance human acceptability.

    title: REMODEL (Robotic technologies for the manipulation of complex deformable linear objects)
    excerpt: >-
      REMODEL aims to enable new production environments, where the manufacturing of complex products composed of multiple wires and cables by means of robots is not only possible, but fully integrated with the product design chain. Wires, cables, wiring harnesses, laces and flexible tubes have a transversal application in many manufacturing processes, where these technologies could lean the scale for a total automation, decreasing the production costs and improving the worker conditions.

#     title: WIRES (Wiring Robotic System for Switchgears)
#     excerpt: >-
#       WIRES aims to improve the production quality of switchgears by automating the currently manual wiring process. The project contributes to both software and hardware development (grippers) to create a robotic solution for wiring. The primary challenge is to develop a new gripper with tactile sensors that can handle deformable objects like wires and operate on screw/clip type connection points simultaneously. All the technologies developed within the WIRES experiment aim to reduce the time required for switchgear wiring and improve product quality
