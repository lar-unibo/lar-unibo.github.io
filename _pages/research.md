    title: Perception and manipulation of Deformable Objects
    excerpt: >-
      We aims to develop advanced robotic sensing and manipulation techniques to enable robots to effectively interact with deformable objects. Our primary focus is on electric wires and wiring harnesses, which are commonly used in various industries. The deformable nature of these objects, coupled with the need for precision in their handling, presents a unique challenge for robotics. By improving the robots' ability to perceive and manipulate electric wires, the project has the potential to increase efficiency and accuracy in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and electronics.
